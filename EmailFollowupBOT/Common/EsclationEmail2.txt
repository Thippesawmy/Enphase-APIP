Dear Manager,
<br><br>
We have not received any response from the requestor regarding the pending invoice and your immediate assistance is required to enable us 
<br>
to match the invoice to the purchase order and pay.
<br><br>
Please review the attached invoice and click the "Approved" hyperlink if such services have been received against this invoice. A new <br>
email window will open then press "Send" button. Do not include additional text in the response or the invoice will not be immediately <br>
processed and will be routed to the Accounts Payable team for investigation. If you do not approve the invoice, click the "Rejected" <br>
hyperlink. In the response email you can give clarification why the invoice was rejected for the Accounts Payable team's investigation. 
<br><br>
