Dear Requestor,
<br><br>
We have not received an email response from you yet.
<br><br>
Please review the attached invoice and click the "Approved" hyperlink if such services have been received against this invoice. 
<br><br>
A new email window will open then press "Send" button. Do not include additional text in the response or the invoice will not be immediately processed
<br>
and will be routed to the Accounts Payable team for investigation. If you do not approve the invoice, click the "Rejected" hyperlink. In the
<br>
response email you can give clarification why the invoice was rejected for the Accounts Payable team's investigation.
<br><br>
Thank you in advance for expediting your action.
<br><br>
