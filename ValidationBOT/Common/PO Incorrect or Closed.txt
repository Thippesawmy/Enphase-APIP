Hi,
<br><br>
Please review the attached invoice and provide your email approval for processing if such services 
<br>
have been received against this invoice
<br><br>
Also, kindly share by email the PO number to match the invoice to. As per our oracle records, the PO 
<br> 
referenced on the invoice is Incorrect/Closed. AP team is unable to pay the vendor without matching  
<br>
the Invoice to a valid PO in Oracle. If there are additional invoices related to the same PO number, 
<br>
please inform the vendor that the PO number must be referenced on the invoice copy for AP Team to process and pay.

<br><br>
