Hi,
<br><br>
Please review the attached invoice and provide your email approval for processing if such services have been received against this invoice.
<br><br>
Also, kindly share by email the PO number to match the invoice to.  AP team is unable to pay the
<br>
vendor without matching the Invoice to a valid PO in Oracle. If there are additional invoices related
<br>
to the same PO number, please inform the vendor that, the PO number must be referenced on 
<br>
invoice copy, for AP Team to process and pay. 
<br><br>
